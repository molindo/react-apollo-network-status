 * Maintainer notice: The goal here is to create a new Apollo Client instance
 * which has the network status link added. Instantiating a new client doesn't
 * work, as otherwise it would have a separate cache â€“ this would lead to
 * mutation results not being incorporated everywhere. Providing the cache
 * during initialization isn't enough, probably due to separate internal QueryManager
 * instances (they have a list of queries to notify after a mutation result).
 *
 * The approach here is to copy the instance along with all its configuration
 * and to patch the link on the new instance.
